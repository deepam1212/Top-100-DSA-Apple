**Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.**


 https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
```swift
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Constraints:**
```swift
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
```

**Solution**

```swift
class Solution {
    func lengthOfLongestSubstring(_ s: String) -> Int {
        //
        var charArr: [Character] = Array(s)
        var left: Int = 0
        var pair: [Character: Int] = [:]
        var maxLength: Int = 0
        //
        for right in 0..<charArr.count {
            let ch = charArr[right]
            if let prev = pair[ch], left <= prev {
                left = prev + 1
            }
            pair[ch] = right
            maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1)
        }
        //
        return maxLength
    }
}
```

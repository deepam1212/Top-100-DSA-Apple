**Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:**
```swift
Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
```

**Note:**
```swift
A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 ```

**Example 1:**
![Sudoku](assets/sudoku.png)


```swift
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
```
**Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.**

**Solution**

```swift
class Solution {
    func isValidSudoku(_ board: [[Character]]) -> Bool {
        var myBoard = board
        for i in 0..<9 {
            for j in 0..<9 {
                if myBoard[i][j] != "." {
                    let ch = myBoard[i][j]
                    myBoard[i][j] = "."
                    if !isValid(board: myBoard, row: i, col: j, char: ch) {
                        return false
                    }
                    myBoard[i][j] = ch
                }
            }
        }
        return true
    }

    private func solve(board: inout [[Character]]) -> Bool {
        for i in 0..<9 {
            for j in 0..<9 {
                if board[i][j] == "." {
                    for char in "123456789" {
                        if isValid(board: board, row: i, col: j, char: char) {
                            board[i][j] = char
                            if solve(board: &board) {
                                return true
                            } else {
                                board[i][j] = "."
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }
        }
       return true
    }

    private func isValid(board: [[Character]], row: Int, col: Int, char: Character) -> Bool {
        for i in 0..<9 {
            if board[row][i] == char { return false }
            if board[i][col] == char { return false }

            let myRow = 3 * (row / 3) + i / 3
            let myCol = 3 * (col / 3) + i % 3
            if board[myRow][myCol] == char { return false }
        }
        return true
    }
}
```
